### Short Description
> Proving ground for data and description standards development for Learning Resource Metadata, Learning Objectives, Learning Resources, SIL Courses, Learning Event descriptions.

### Long Description
We are developing a set of tools for managing the various public standards we are creating. This is is where we share code and data sets.

We have several projects currently in this repo:
1. Our implementation of LRMI with our custom taxonomies.
2. Our custom taxonomies:
  * GOLD based Linguistics taxonomy Expressed as XML and JSON
  * SIL Course listing expressed as JSON and XML
  * SIL Competencies expressed as JSON and XML

The expressed format is to enable tools like RAMP and CornerStone on Demand to import our competencies.

  - [API](#api)
  - [Contribute](#contribute)
  - [License](#license)

### Background
**Status:** Optional.

**Requirements:**
- Cover motivation.
- Cover abstract dependencies.
- Cover intellectual provenance: A `See Also` section is also fitting.

### Install
**Status:** Required by default, optional for doc modules.

**Requirements:**
- Code block illustrating how to install.

**Subsections:**
- `Dependencies`. Required if there are unusual dependencies or dependencies that must be manually installed.
- `Updating`. Optional.

**Suggestions:**
- Link to prerequisite sites for programming language: [npmjs](https://npmjs.com), [godocs](https://godoc.org), etc.
- Include any system-specific information needed for installation.
- If there is no code in the module - for instance, a document-based module - this section is not required.

### Usage
**Status:** Required by default, optional for doc modules.

**Requirements:**
- Code block illustrating common usage.
- If CLI compatible, code block indicating common usage.
- If importable, code block indicating both import functionality and usage.

**Subsections:**
- `CLI`. Required if CLI functionality exists.

**Suggestions:**
- Cover basic choices that may affect usage: for instance, if JavaScript, cover promises/callbacks, ES6 here.
- If relevant, point to a runnable file for the usage code.
- If there is no code in the module - for instance, a document-based module - this section is not required.

### Extra Sections
**Status**: Optional.

**Requirements:**
- None.

**Suggestions:**
- Does not require its own title, however the sections included within it must have titles.
- This should contain any other sections that are relevant, placed after [Usage](#usage) and before [API](#api).
- Specifically, the [Security](#security) section should be here if it wasn't important enough to be placed above.

### API
**Status:** Optional.

**Requirements:**
- Describe exported functions and objects.

**Suggestions:**
- Describe signatures, return types, callbacks, and events.
- Cover types covered where not obvious.
- Describe caveats.
- If using an external API generator (like go-doc, js-doc, or so on), point to an external `API.md` file. This can be the only item in the section, if present.

### Contribute
**Status**: Required.

**Requirements:**
- State where users can ask questions.
- State whether PRs are accepted.
- List any requirements for contributing; for instance, having a sign-off on commits.

**Suggestions:**
- Link to a contributing or contribute file -- if there is one.
- Be as friendly as possible.
- Link to the GitHub issues.
- Link to Code of Conduct. This is often in Contribute, or organization wide, so may not be necessary for each module.
- A subsection for listing contributors is also welcome here.

### License
**Status:** Required. (Exact License still pending)

**Requirements:**
- State license initials or name.
- State license owner.
- Must be last section.

**Suggestions:**
